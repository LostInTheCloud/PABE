# Notebook App

We got a new app that allows you to take notes. There are two kinds of notes simple and printable ones. The app is still work in progress so there might still be some bugs. Try to find the bug and exploit it to print the flag.
As always, describe what you are doing with technical details so that we see that you fully understood the vulnerability and the exploit.

Once again, edit the provided `solution` template and explain your approach with meaningful comments!

Your solution should look like:

```
./solution
FLAG{some letters}
```
