# Say my name!

We have reused code from an old authentication system.
It seems like security was not that important in these days...

Can you check if the binary `say_my_name` has a vulnerability?
If so, exploit it to make the binary print the flag.
To do so, edit the provided `solution` template!

Where is the bug and how can it be fixed?
Write the answer as a comment!

Your solution should look like:

```
$ ./solution
FLAG{some letters and digits}
```
