# Shellter your code!

We finally removed the unnecessary code that you might have found in the previous task!
Is our new binary `shellter_your_code` still exploitable?
If it is, show us how and print the flag...

Again, edit the provided `solution` template!

Your solution should look like:

```
$ ./solution
FLAG{some letters and digits}
```
