# Reverse Me

Seeing how effortless you managed to parse integers on the last sheet, we fired our old programmer without further consideration. However, we were informed that his legacy code still drives a part of our system.

We found one of these binaries: `reverseme`. Please re-implement its functionality as a Python script. Are there any specific error cases to be considered? We can not remember him ever implementing *so many* functions!?

Hints: 
- Use all the tools we mentioned in the lecture to get a good overview first! 
- What is a callback?
